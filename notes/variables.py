# best practices:

# - use snake_case
# - start with lowercase or underscore
# - letters, numbers, underscores
# - case sensitive
# - can't overwrite keywords
# - use all caps for constants (PI = 3.14)
# - don't use __
# - name things well so that your code runs like English

a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# expressions vs. statements

# - expressions produce a value (21 + 64)
# - statements are whole lines of code (iq = 21 + 64)
