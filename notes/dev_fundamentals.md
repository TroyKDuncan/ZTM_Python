1. Don't read the dictionary
  - most developers are constantly googling things
  - there is too much to memorize
  - focus on the 20% that is used 80% of the time

2. Commenting your code
  - when commenting your code, add VALUABLE comments
  - code should be clear and understandable
  - focus on making code simple and readable instead of clever 
  - if the code is complex, add comments to make it
    easier to understand
  - if the code is unnecessarily complex, make it 
    easier to read

3. Understanding Data Structures
  - know when to use what
  - lists have order, but dictionaries don't
  - a line of people would probably work better with a list:

line = ['Troy','Taylor','Nora','Milo']

  - dictionaries hold a lot more information

character = {
  'name': 'Troy',
  'inventory': ['sword','axe','scroll','shield','potion'],
  'race': 'khajit',
  'height': 2, # in meters
  'speed': 45
}

4. What is good code?
  - clean, following best practices and standard formatting
  - readability, easy to understand, variable names help instead of hurt
  - predictability, nothing too fancy
  - DRY, dont repeat yourself (use functions for reusablility)

5. Test your assumptions
  - try things to test what you are learning
  - don't just watch the videos; try things and see how they work

6. Pros and cons of libraries
  - make sure you are using GOOD packages
  - ask yourself if you can write something yourself instead of pulling something else in
